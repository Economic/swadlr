# swadlr

<!-- badges: start -->

swadlr provides access to the [EPI State of Working America Data
Library](https://data.epi.org) (SWADL) API.

## Examples

Use swadlr if you need to programmatically retrieve a time series from SWADL:

```r
get_swadl(
  indicator = "hourly_wage_percentiles",
  measure = "nominal_wage",
  dimension = list("wage_percentile" = "wage_p50")
)
```

For a summary of what is available for a given indicator

```r
swadl_indicator("hourly_wage_percentiles")
```

If you have the need to retrieve multiple, don't use the API and instead simply [download all the data](https://economic.github.io/data/).

## Installation

You can install swadlr from [r-universe](https://economic.r-universe.dev/swadlr):

```r
install.packages(
  "swadlr",
  repos = c("https://economic.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

## Documentation

See the [package website](https://economic.github.io/swadlr/) for full

vignette](https://economic.github.io/swadlr/articles/swadlr.html) for more
